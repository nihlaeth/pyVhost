# pyVhost
Easily create virtual hosts using nginx

Adding yet another website to your server can be
tedious. That's why I created this script - to
consolidate some repetitive actions. It's meant
for my own system, not for general use, but feel
free to adapt it for your own system.

## To-Do
* better nginx config templates
* replace templating engine so we can use a single template
* add tests (& do some testing while you're at it)
* option to generate ssl certificates
